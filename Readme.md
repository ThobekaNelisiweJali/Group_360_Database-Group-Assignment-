# üõçÔ∏è E-Commerce Platform Database Project

## Project Overview

This project is a collaborative team effort to **design, build, and implement a relational database** for an e-commerce platform. The aim is to showcase our understanding of data modeling, SQL scripting, and team-based system analysis and design.

The platform supports multiple product types, variations, and attributes, and includes detailed tracking of inventory, product images, brands, and sizes.

## Deliverables

1. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
   - A visual model of all tables, attributes, and relationships.
   - Created using draw.io and dbdiagram.io.
   - Clearly shows primary and foreign key relationships.

2. **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**
   - A flowchart showing how data moves between components in the system.
   - Highlights user interactions, system boundaries, and database exchanges.

3. **Database Schema (SQL Script)**
   - `ecommerce.sql` contains the SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements to set up the schema.
   - Includes primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

4. **GitHub Repository**
   - Hosts all documentation, diagrams, and code.
   - Demonstrates use of version control and group collaboration.

5. **Team Collaboration**
   - A shared analysis and implementation effort.
   - Clear documentation of roles and responsibilities.
